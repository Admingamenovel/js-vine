<h1>JS-ViNE: A JavaScript Visual Novel Engine</h1>
<p>
In March of 2010, I wrote a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel">visual novel</a> (VN) to
explain hypothesis testing to my Psychology
Research Methods class. I used the <a href="http://www.renpy.org/">Ren'py</a>
visual novel engine, and it worked great.
Grant Paton-Simpson, the author of
<a href="http://sofastatistics.com/">SOFA - Statistics Open For All</a>
liked the content, but said he would prefer if it were web-based instead of
having to download an executable file.
</p>

<p>
After some experimentation, I have come up with a visual novel engine written
in JavaScript. It is not meant as a replacement for Ren'py; I just wrote it
so I could transfer my tutorial to the web. I did, however, try to convert
<i>The Question</i>, an example VN that comes with Ren'py, and it seems to
work somewhat.  You can try both of these visual novels by selecting
from the following list. Once the novel starts, just click in the novel
window to proceed.
